He had no frank instability to it, however.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.,On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.  Marcaine was injected into the portal sites.  We placed a sterile dressing and stockinet on the left lower extremity.  He was transferred to the gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.","orthopedic, medial meniscoplasty, arthroscopic, chondroplasty, arthroscopy, medial femoral condyle, medial meniscus, knee, meniscal, cartilage, meniscoplasty, meniscus, chondromalacia, condyle, femoral"

An Armstrong grommet tube was placed down through the incision and rotated into place.  The opposite ear was then cleaned out under the microscope.  Serous fluid was aspirated from the middle ear space.  An Armstrong grommet tube was placed down through the incision and rotated into place.  Cortisporin suspension was placed in both ear canals.,Then the patient was intubated.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed into the mouth and extended and hung on the Mayo stand.  The red rubber catheter was placed down through the nose and brought out through the mouth to retract the palate.  The adenoid fossa was visualized with the mirror.  The adenoids were removed using the microdebrider.  Two adenoid packs were placed.  The packs were removed one by one.  Using mirror and suction bovie, adequate hemostasis was achieved.,The tonsils were quite large and cryptic.  The tenaculum was placed on the superior pole of the right tonsil.  Cheesy material came out from the crypts.  The tonsils were retracted medially.  The bovie electrocautery was used to make an incision in the right anterior tonsillar pillar, and the plane was developed between the tonsil and the musculature.  The tonsil was completely dissected out of this plane, preserving both the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars.  All bleeders were cauterized as they were encountered.  The tenaculum was then placed on the superior pole of the left tonsil.  Cheesy material came out from the crypts.  The tonsils were retracted medially.

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition.","orthopedic, glenohumeral rotator cuff, arthroscopy, degenerative joint disease, shoulder hemiarthroplasty, rotator, cuff, subscapular, shoulder, "

Multiple adhesions around the stomach to the diaphragm and liver.,HISTORY: ,The patient is a 59-year-old black male who is indigent, an ethanol and tobacco abuse. He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.,OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: ,A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.",

 An example/template for meatoplasty., Surgery,"OPERATIVE NOTE:  ,The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia, and prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The penis was inspected.  The meatus was inspected and an incision was made in the dorsal portion of the meatus up towards the tip of the penis connecting this with the ventral urethral groove.  This was incised longitudinally and closed transversely with 5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The meatus was calibrated and accepted the calibrating instrument without difficulty, and there was no stenosis.  An incision was made transversely below the meatus in a circumferential way around the shaft of the penis, bringing up the skin of the penis from the corpora.  The glans was undermined with sharp dissection and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  Using a skin hook, the meatus was elevated ventrally and the glans flaps were reapproximated using 5-0 chromic catgut, creating a new ventral portion of the glans using the flaps of skin.  There was good viability of the skin.  The incision around the base of the penis was performed, separating the foreskin that was going to be removed from the coronal skin.  This was removed and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated at the base of the penis for post-op pain relief, and the coronal and penile skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut.  At the conclusion of the procedure, Vaseline gauze was wrapped around the penis.  There was good hemostasis and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, penis, meatus, urethral groove, corpora, glans, meatoplasty, bovie, chromic, catgut, hemostasisNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

 Patient with fever of unknown origin., General Medicine,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: , Fever of unknown origin.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 39-year-old woman with polymyositis/dermatomyositis on methotrexate once a week.  The patient has also been on high-dose prednisone for an urticarial rash.  The patient was admitted because of persistent high fevers without a clear-cut source of infection.  She had been having temperatures of up to 103 for 8-10 days.  She had been seen at Alta View Emergency Department a week prior to admission.  A workup there including chest x-ray, blood cultures, and a transthoracic echocardiogram had all remained nondiagnostic, and were normal.  Her chest x-ray on that occasion was normal.  After the patient was seen in the office on August 10, she persisted with high fevers and was admitted on August 11 to Cottonwood Hospital.  Studies done at Cottonwood:  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Results:  CT chest showed mild bibasilar pleural-based interstitial changes.  These were localized to mid and lower lung zones.  The process was not diffuse.  There was no ground glass change.  CT abdomen and pelvis was normal.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained.  Dr. XYZ saw the patient.  He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR.  Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD.  The CMV serology came back positive for IgM.  The IgG was negative.  The CMV blood PCR was positive, as well.  Other serologies and her PPD stayed negative.  Blood cultures stayed negative.,In view of the positive CMV, PCR, and the changes in her CAT scan, the patient was taken for a bronchoscopy.  BAL and transbronchial biopsies were performed.  The transbronchial biopsies did not show any evidence of pneumocystis, fungal infection, AFB.  There was some nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, which was minimal.  I spoke with the pathologist, Dr. XYZ and immunopathology was done to look for CMV.  The patient had 3 nucleoli on the biopsy specimens that stained positive and were consistent with CMV infection.  The patient was started on ganciclovir once her CMV serologies had come back positive.  No other antibiotic therapy was prescribed.  Next, the patient's methotrexate was held.,A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed some bibasilar disease, showing interstitial infiltrates.  The patient was given ibuprofen and acetaminophen during her hospitalization, and her fever resolved with these measures.,On the BAL fluid cell count, the patient only had 5 WBCs and 5 RBCs on the differential.  It showed 43% neutrophils, 45% lymphocytes.,Discussions were held with Dr. XYZ, Dr. XYZ, her rheumatologist, and with pathology.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Disseminated CMV infection with possible CMV pneumonitis.,2.  Polymyositis on immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate and prednisone).,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.

Uterine fibroids.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Abnormal uterine bleeding.,2.  Uterine fibroids.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual manner for a laparoscopic procedure.  A speculum was placed into the vagina.  A single tooth tenaculum was utilized to grasp the anterior lip of the uterine cervix.  The uterus was sounded to 10.5 cm.  A #10 RUMI cannula was utilized and attached for uterine manipulation.  The single-tooth tenaculum and speculum were removed from the vagina.  At this time, the infraumbilical area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and infraumbilical vertical skin incision was made through which a Veress needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity.  Aspiration was negative; therefore the abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide.  After adequate insufflation, Veress needle was removed and an 11-mm separator trocar was introduced through the infraumbilical incision into the abdominal cavity.  Through the trocar sheath, the laparoscope was inserted and adequate visualization of the pelvic structures was noted.  At this time, the suprapubic area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine.  A 5-mm skin incision was made and a 5-mm trocar was introduced into the abdominal cavity for instrumentation.  Evaluation of the pelvis revealed the uterus to be slightly enlarged and irregular.  The fallopian tubes have been previously interrupted surgically.  The ovaries appeared normal bilaterally.  The cul-de-sac was clean without evidence of endometriosis, scarring or adhesions.  The ureters were noted to be deep in the pelvis.  At this time, the right cornu was grasped and the right fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected without difficulty.  The remainder of the uterine vessels and anterior and posterior leaves of the broad ligament, as well as the cardinal ligament was coagulated and transected in a serial fashion down to level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  A similar procedure was carried out on the left with the left uterine cornu identified.  The left fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The remainder of the cardinal ligament, uterine vessels, anterior, and posterior sheaths of the broad ligament were coagulated and transected in a serial manner to the level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was then dissected to the midline bilaterally, establishing a bladder flap with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  At this time, attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The laparoscope was removed and attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The RUMI cannula was removed and the anterior and posterior leafs of the cervix were grasped with Lahey tenaculum.  A circumferential injection with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was made at the cervicovaginal portio.  A circumferential incision was then made at the cervicovaginal portio.  The anterior and posterior colpotomies were accomplished with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection without difficulty.  The right uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The left uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The parametrial tissue was then clamped bilaterally, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture bilaterally.  The uterus was then removed and passed off the operative field.  Laparotomy pack was placed into the pelvis.  The pedicles were evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted; therefore, the laparotomy pack was removed.  The uterosacral ligaments were suture fixated into the vaginal cuff angles with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The vaginal cuff was then closed in a running fashion with #0 Vicryl suture.  Hemostasis was noted throughout.  At this time, the laparoscope was reinserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was reinsufflated.  Evaluation revealed no further bleeding.  Irrigation with sterile water was performed and again no bleeding was noted.  The suprapubic trocar sheath was then removed under laparoscopic visualization.  The laparoscope was removed.  The carbon dioxide was allowed to escape from the abdomen and the infraumbilical trocar sheath was then removed.  The skin incisions were closed with #4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Neosporin and Band-Aid were applied for dressing and the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss was approximately 100 mL.  There were no complications.  The instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct.","surgery, abnormal uterine bleeding, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, uterine fibroids, bipolar electrocautery, vaginal hysterectomy, vicryl sutures, tooth, uterine, uterosacral, laparoscope, electrocautery, hysterectomy, laparoscopic, coagulated, vaginal, ligament, transected"
" Excision of soft tissue mass, right foot.  The patient is a 51-year-old female with complaints of soft tissue mass over the dorsum of the right foot.", Podiatry,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Soft tissue mass, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Soft tissue mass, right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Excision of soft tissue mass, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 51-year-old female with complaints of soft tissue mass over the dorsum of the right foot.  The patient has had previous injections to the site which have caused the mass to decrease in size, however, the mass continues to be present and is irritated and painful with shoes.  The patient has requested surgical intervention at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted from the preoperative holding area to the operating room.  The patient was then placed on the operating room table in the supine position and a towel was placed around the patient's abdomen and secured her to the table.  Using copious amounts of Webril, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied to her right ankle.  Using a Skin Skribe, the area of the soft tissue mass was outlined over the dorsum of her foot.  After adequate amount of anesthesia was provided by the Department of Anesthesia, a local ankle block was given using 10 cc of 4.5 mL of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1.0 mL of Solu-Medrol and the foot was scrubbed and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  Following this, the ankle was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot and the ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought back down to the table using bandage scissors.  The stockinette was reflected and the right foot was exposed.  Using a fresh #10 blade, a curvilinear incision was performed over the dorsum of the right foot.  Then using a #15 blade, the incision was deepened with care taken to identify and avoid or cauterize any bleeders which were noted.  Following this, the incision was deepened using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection and the muscle belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle was identified.  Further dissection was then performed in the medial direction in the area of the soft tissue mass.  The intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve was identified and gently retracted laterally.  Large amounts of adipose tissue were noted medial to the belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle.  Using careful dissection, adipose tissue in this area was removed and saved for pathology.  Following removal of adipose tissue in this area and identification of no more adipose tissue, attention was directed lateral to the belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, which was also noted to have large amounts of adipose tissue in this area as well.  Using careful dissection, from the lateral border of the foot as much adipose tissue as possible was removed from this area as well and saved for pathology.  There was noted to be no other fluid-filled masses or lesions identifiable in this area then between the slits of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, careful dissection was performed to examine the underside of the belly of the muscle as well as structures beneath and no abnormal structures were identified here as well.  Following this, feeling adequately that no other mass remained in the area, the incision was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline.  The wound was then reinspected and all remaining tissues appeared healthy including the subcutaneous tissue.  The tendon and muscle belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, the nerves of the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve and also the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve which were identified medially, all appeared intact.  No deficits were noted.  No abnormal appearing tissue was present within the surgical site.  Following this, the skin edges were reapproximated using #4-0 Vicryl deep closure of the subcutaneous layer was performed.  Then, using #4-0 nylon and simple interrupted suture, the skin was reapproximated and closed with care taken to ensure eversion of the skin edges and good approximation of the borders.  The patient was also given 7 cc of 1% lidocaine plain throughout the procedure to augment local anesthesia.  Following this, the wound was dressed using Xeroform gauze and 4x4s and was dressed using two ABD pads, dorsal and plantar for compression and using Kling, Kerlix and Coban.  The patient then had the ankle tourniquet deflated with a total tourniquet time of 55 minutes at 250 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to digits one through five of the right foot.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was noted to have vascular status intact.  The patient was then escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where she was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then given postoperative instructions to include ice and elevation to her right foot.  The patient was cleared for ambulation as tolerated, but was instructed that with increased ambulation will come increased swelling and pain.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X in his office on Tuesday, 08/26/03 for further follow up.  The patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen #25 taken one tablet q.4h. p.r.n., moderate to severe pain and also prescription for Keflex #20 500 mg tablets to be taken b.i.d. x10 days.  The patient was given a number for the Emergency Room and instructed to return if any sign or symptom of infection should present and the patient was educated as to the nature of these.  The patient had no further questions and recovered without any complications in the Postanesthesia Care Unit.","podiatry, excision, digitorum brevis muscle, soft tissue mass, adipose tissue, soft tissue, mass, injections, foot, tissue, xeroform, dorsum, belly, extensor, digitorum, brevis, ankle, adipose, muscle, "

Live male infant with Apgars of 9 and 9.,2.  Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.,SUMMARY: , This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who was pregnant since 40 weeks 6 days when she was admitted for induction of labor for post dates with favorable cervix.  When she was admitted, her cervix was 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tones were 120s and reactive.  She was started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membranes with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and was unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby was at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tones were in the 80s and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.,The baby's head was confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum was injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder was drained.  The vacuum was placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle was confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was inflated and a gentle downward pressure was used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum was released and the fetal heart tones remained in the, at this time, 90s to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was reapplied and the baby's head was delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver was used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum was deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There was no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a less than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuvers were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped x2 and cut.  The infant was handed to the respiratory therapist.,Pitocin was added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration as well as a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration was also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia was used.  The capsule was visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It was reinforced with three separate interrupted sutures and then the remainder of the incision was closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, crying and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.  The total time for repair of the laceration was 25 minutes.","obstetrics / gynecology, intrauterine pregnancy, non-reassuring fetal heart tones, vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, vaginal side wall laceration, fetal heart tones, vaginal delivery, vacuum assisted, laceration, intrauterine, tones, contractions, "

The patient states she had been thinking about suicide for a couple of weeks.  Felt that her Huntington disease had worsened and she wanted to spare her family and husband from trouble.  Reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression.  Husband notes that on Monday after speaking to Dr. X, they had been advised to alternate the patient's Pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth.  They did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression.  The patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on Friday.  She thought Friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened.  Her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping.  About 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital.,She says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the Huntington gene.

The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.  Overall prognosis is good.","orthopedic, laceration, flexor tendon, volar laceration, digital laceration, ulnar slip, flexor digitorum, neurovascular bundle, nerve, injury, ring, finger, neurovascular, fds, bundle, tendon, repair, flexor, digital, ulnar, "

Extensive anterior abdominal wall/uterine/bladder adhesiolysis.,ANESTHESIA:,  Spinal/epidural with good effect.,FINDINGS:  ,Delivered vigorous male infant from cephalic presentation.  Apgars 9/9.  Birth weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Infant suctioned with a bulb upon delivery of the head and body.  Cord clamped and cut and infant passed to pediatric team present.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision.  In addition, the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex.  A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions.  These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall.  Upon initial entry through the fibrous layer of the anterior abdominal wall _______ into the serosal and slightly muscular part of the anterior uterus due to the dense adhesion attachment that had occurred from previous surgeries.  Bilateral tubal ligation performed without difficulty via Parkland technique.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,URINE OUTPUT:  ,Per anesthesia records.  Urine cleared postoperatively.,IV FLUIDS:  ,Per anesthesia records.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition with stable vital signs.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was placed in a supine position after spinal/epidural anesthesia.  She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section.  A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar.  This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife.  This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient's previous surgeries.  Upon entry, incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision.  Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer.  A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus.  Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall.  This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall.  Inferiorly, difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall.  These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp, blunt, and electrocautery dissection.  This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder.  Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus.  The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision.  This was extended with bandage scissors.  The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation.  Bulb suction was done following delivery of the head and body.  The cord clamped and cut and the infant passed to pediatric team present.  Cord segment and cord blood was obtained.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Vigorous male infant, Apgars 9/9, weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Complete placenta with three vessels retrieved.  Uterus was exteriorized from the abdominal cavity.  Wet lap applied to the fundus and dry lap used to remove the remaining membranous tissue from the lining.  Pennington clamps placed at the uterine incision angles and the inferior incision lip.  A #1 chromic suture closed the uterus in running continuous interlocking closure.  Good hemostasis upon completion of the closure.  Laparotomy pads placed in the posterior cul-de-sac to remove any blood or clots.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity, after using #1 chromic suture to close the anterior uterine incision, that was partial thickness through the serosal end of the muscular layer at midline adhesion.  This was closed with chromic suture in a running continuous interlocking closure with good hemostasis.  Attention was then focused on the bilateral tubal ligation.  Babcock clamp placed in the mid fallopian tube and elevated.  Cautery was used to make a window in the avascular segment of the mesosalpinx.  Proximal and distal #1 chromic suture ligation with mid fallopian tube transection performed.  The ligated proximal and distal stumps were then cauterized with Bovie cautery.  This tubal ligation procedure was done in a bilateral fashion.  Upon completion of tubal ligation, uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  Left and right gutters examined and found to be clean and dry.  Evaluation of the low uterine segment incision revealed continued hemostasis.  Oozing was encountered in the inferior bladder of dissection and 2-0 chromic suture in running continuous fashion, partial thickness of the bladder to control the oozing at this site was successfully done.  Interceed was then placed on the low uterine incision and the low anterior uterine aspect.  The midline rectus including peritoneum was re-approximated with simple interrupted chromic sutures.  Irrigation of the muscular layer with good hemostasis noted.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl in a running continuous closure.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated, additional hemostasis with Bovie cautery.  The skin was closed with staples.","surgery, term pregnancy, sterilization, low-transverse cesarean section, bilateral tubal ligation, adhesiolysis, anterior uterus, abdominal cavity, cesarean section, chromic suture, tubal ligation, adhesions, uterus, abdominal, infant, anterior, cesarean, hemostasis, chromic, uterine, "

 3-Dimensional Simulation.  This patient is undergoing 3-dimensionally planned radiation therapy in order to adequately target structures at risk while diminishing the degree of exposure to uninvolved adjacent normal structures., Hematology - Oncology,"3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION,This patient is undergoing 3-dimensionally planned radiation therapy in order to adequately target structures at risk while diminishing the degree of exposure to uninvolved adjacent normal structures.  This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects.  With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived.  Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician.  Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the  immobilization device.,The patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are performed through the targeted area.  The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images.  The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures.  This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features.  Appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures.,Once appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised.  If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated.,In view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470.","hematology - oncology, 3-dimensional simulation, planned radiation therapy, ct scan, ct images, beam's eye view, field arrangements, normal structures, therapy, dimensional, simulationNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

 Laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy due to right renal mass., Nephrology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right renal mass.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right renal mass.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  250 mL.,X-RAYS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , Included right renal mass as well as biopsies from the base of the resection.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DRAINS: , Included a JP drain in the right flank as well as a #16-French Foley catheter per urethra.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of an enhancing right renal mass approximately 2 cm in diameter.  I had a long discussion with him concerning variety of options.  We talked in particular about extirpated versus ablative surgery.  Based on his young age and excellent state of health, decision was made at this point to proceed to a right partial nephrectomy laparoscopically.  All questions were answered, and he wished to proceed with surgery as planned.  Note that the patient does have a positive family history of renal cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After acquisition of proper informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via endotracheal rod, he was placed into the right anterior flank position with his right side elevated on a roll and his right arm across his chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and he was securely taped to the table.  Note that sequential compression devices were in place on both lower extremities and were activated prior to induction of anesthesia.  His abdomen was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Note that a #16-French Foley catheter was in place per urethra as well as an orogastric tube.  The abdomen was insufflated at the right lateral abdomen using the Veress needle to a pressure of 15 without incident.  We then placed a Visiport 10 x 12 trocar in the right lateral abdomen.  With the trocar in place, we were able to place the remaining trocars under direct laparoscopic visualization.  We placed three additional trocars.  An 11 mm screw type trocar at the umbilicus, a 6 screw type trocar 7 cm in the midline above the umbilicus, and a 10 x 12 trocar to serve as a retractor port approximately 8 cm inferior in the midline.,The procedure was begun by reflecting the right colon by incising the white line of Toldt.  The colon was reflected medially, and the retroperitoneum was exposed on that side.  This was a fairly superficial lesion, so decision was made in advance to potentially not perform vascular clamping, however, I did feel it important to get high level control prior to proceeding to the partial.  With the colon reflected, the duodenum was identified, and it was reflected medially under Kocher maneuver.  The ureter and gonadal vein were identified on the right side and elevated.  The space between the ureter and the gonadal vein was then developed, and the gonadal vein was dropped elevating only the ureter, and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum.  Once we got up to the renal hilum, we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessels partially, and in particular, we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a Satinsky clamp or bulldogs.  The remainder of the kidney was then freed off its lateral and superior attachments primarily using the Harmonic scalpel and the LigaSure device.,With the kidney free and the hilum prepared, the Gerota fascia was taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma, and using this approach, we were able to identify the 2-cm, right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally.  A cap of fat was left overlying this mass.  Based on the position of the mass, we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound, which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated.  Based on this finding, I decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection.  A Satinsky clamp was introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc.  Note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure, and he also received Lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum.  With the renal hilum clamped, we did resect the tumor using cold scissors.  There was somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping; however, we were able to successfully resect this lesion.  We also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table as a specimen for frozen section.  With the tumor resected, the base of the resection was then cauterized using the Argon beam coagulator, and several bleeding vessels were oversewn using figure-of-eight 3-0 Vicryl sutures with lap ties for tensioning.  We then placed a FloSeal into the wound and covered it with a Surgicel and held the pressure.  We then released the vascular clamp.  Total clamp time was 11 minutes.  There was minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver, and after unclamping the kidney, the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp.  We then replaced the kidney within its Gerota envelope and closed that with 3-0 Vicryl using lap ties for tensioning.  A JP drain was introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 2-0 nylon.  The specimen was placed into a 10-mm Endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm.  It was evaluated on the table and passed off the table for Pathology to evaluate.  They stated that the tumor was close to the margin, but there appeared to be 1-2 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor.  In addition, the frozen section biopsies from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma.  Based on these findings, the lower most trocar site was closed using a running 0 Vicryl suture in the fascia.  We then re-insufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis.  Any bleeding points were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips.  The area was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The colon was then replaced into its normal anatomic position.  The mesentry was evaluated.  There were no defects noted.  We closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a Carter-Thompson closure device with 0-Vicryl.  All trocars were removed under direct visualization, and the abdomen was desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar.  The skin incisions were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, and the skin was closed using a running 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Benzoin and Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient was returned in supine position and awoken from general anesthetic without incident.  He was then transferred to hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit for postoperative monitoring.  At the end of the case, sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct.  I was scrubbed and present throughout the entire case.","nephrology, renal mass, foley catheter, gerota fascia, jp drain, kocher maneuver, laparoscopic, ligasure device, satinsky clamp, toldt, bulldogs, nephrectomy, renal parenchyma, resection, urethra, vicryl sutures, partial nephrectomy, gonadal vein, renal hilum, satinsky, renal, kidney, hilum, foley, endotracheal, "

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.","surgery, cervical spondylosis, cervical fusion, decompression, instrumentation, anterior cervical discectomy, anterior cervical, herniated disc, cervical discectomy, anterior, cervical, fusion, allograft, discectomy"
" Patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.", Consult - History and Phy.,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: , Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: , The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times ""I do not feel well"" and looked ""glazed.""  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.,In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.,During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he ""felt fine the whole time.""  He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  So, The patient reported some age related ""memory lapses"" such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  He does not have to recheck information for errors.  He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  He remains completely independent in his ADLs.  He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  He is also able to handle their finances.  He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  Note that due to back pain, he had been taking Percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, Vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  He denied any illicit drug use.  Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient's sleep deprived EEG was recommended.,MRI completed on 09/30/09 showed ""mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007.  No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  EEG was negative.  Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:, Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  In addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  He has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore.

" Back pain and right leg pain.  Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs", Orthopedic,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Back pain and right leg pain.  The patient has a three-year history of small cell lung cancer with metastases.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is on my schedule today to explore treatment of the above complaints.  She has a two-year history of small cell lung cancer, which she says has spread to metastasis in both femurs, her lower lumbar spine, and her pelvis.  She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count.  She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief.  She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms.  Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee.  She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times.  She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain.  She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature.  She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.  She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking.  She is on significant doses of narcotics.  She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for cancer as above.  She also has a depression.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for a chest port placement.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.

No focal muscle weakness.  She is deconditioned.,Neurologic:  She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect.  The patient has normal tone and coordination.  Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles.  Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick.,Spine:  Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement.  The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints.,FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: , Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.,INVESTIGATION: , She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally.  She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally.  CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease.  CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs.  CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases.  CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan.  MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs.,2.  Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right.,3.  Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  We have asked for stat protime today.  She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed.  I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday.  I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.  Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings.  Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.",

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating her dysrhythmia.  However, given the risk of thromboembolic complications, would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible.  Given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago, this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours.  We will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous (IV) bolus followed by mg/minute at this juncture.  If she does not have spontaneous cardioversion, we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone.,As part of amiodarone protocol, please check TSH.  Given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases, we will follow LFTs closely, while on amiodarone.,2.  Thromboembolic risk prophylaxis, as discussed above.  No immediate indication for anticoagulation.  If however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours, we will need to initiate therapy.  This was discussed with Dr. X.  Preference would be to run intravenous heparin with PTT of 45 during her thrombocytopenic nadir and initiation of full-dose anticoagulation once nadir is resolved.,3.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient is clinically euvolemic.  Elevated BNP possibly secondary to infarct or renal insufficiency.  Follow volume status closely.  Follow serial BNPs.,4.  Followup.  The patient will be followed while in-house, recommendations made as clinically appropriate.",

Some degree of peripheral neuropathy, consistent with diabetic neuropathy, encouraged her to watch her diet and exercise daily.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.,Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ,Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.,MEDICATIONS:,  Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She drinks alcohol occasionally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms.  Remainder of her full 14-point review of system was unremarkable.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On examination, the patient was pleasant.  She was able to speak English fairly well.  Her blood pressure was 130/84.  Heart rate was 80.  Respiratory rate was 16.  Her weight was 188 pounds.  Her pain score was 0/10.  Her general exam was completely unremarkable.  Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain.  She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot.  There was no ataxia.  She was able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.,She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable.  She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, Ménière's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.,I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.,She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.  I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms.","consult - history and phy., nausea, dizziness, migraine, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, neuropathy, positional vertigo, photophobia and dizziness, neurology consultation, tunnel vision, vestibular migraine, migraine symptoms, headaches, photophobia, ataxia, "

A scalpel was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision, which was carried down sharply through the subcutaneous tissue to the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the midline and incision was carried laterally bilaterally with curved Mayo scissors.  The fascia was then bluntly and sharply dissected free from the underlying rectus abdominis muscles.  The rectus abdominis muscles were then bluntly dissected in the midline and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The peritoneum was then bluntly entered and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The O'Connor-O'Sullivan instrument was then placed without difficulty.  The uterus was grasped with a thyroid clamp and the entire pelvis was then visualized without difficulty.  The GIA stapling instrument was then used to separate the infundibulopelvic ligament in a ligated fashion from the body of the uterus.  This was performed on the left infundibulopelvic ligament and the right infundibulopelvic ligament without difficulty.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  The bladder flap was then developed free from the uterus without difficulty.  Careful dissection of the uterus from the pedicle with the uterine arteries and cardinal ligaments was then performed using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion on the left and right side.  This was done without difficulty.  The uterine fundus was then separated from the uterine cervix without difficulty.  This specimen was sent to pathology for identification.  The cervix was then developed with careful dissection.  Jorgenson scissors were then used to remove the cervix from the vaginal cuff.  This was sent to pathology for identification.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  A #1 chromic suture ligature was then used in running fashion at the angles and along the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  Figure-of-eight sutures were then used in an interrupted fashion to close the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  The entire pelvis was washed.  Hemostasis was noted.  The peritoneum was then closed using 2-0 chromic suture ligature in running pursestring fashion.  The rectus abdominis muscles were approximated using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion.  The fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in interlocking running fashion.

Indications, alternatives, risks, consequences, benefits, and details of the procedure including specifically the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or paralysis or vocal cord dysfunction and possible trach were discussed with the patient in detail.  She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history was reviewed and physical examinations was evaluated.  The patient was brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine was infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade was then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection was carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma was identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane was created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral directions using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscles were identified.  The midline raphe was not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision was made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection was carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It was noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection was utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia as well as strap muscles off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This was carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule was then identified.  A hemostat was placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was placed in this area.  A second Kitner was placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid was retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection was then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessels and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This was carried out until the superior pole was identified.  Careful attention was made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection was then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid was then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve was then identified and tracked to its insertion.  The overlying vessels of the middle thyroid vein as well as the associated structures were then identified and great attention was made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it was completed, this lobule was then removed from Berry's ligament.  There was noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule was then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention was then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were already separated.  Army-Navy as well as femoral retractors were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein was identified.  Blunt dissection was carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat was utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was then placed in this area.  Another Kitner was placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection was utilized to identify the appropriate structures in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature as well as bipolar cautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention was made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole was then freed appropriately and blunt dissection was carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect was then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid was then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve has been identified.  A careful dissection was then carried out to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side as close to the thyroid gland as possible.  The thyroid was then removed from the Berry's ligament and it was then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This was irrigated and pinpoint areas were bipolored as necessary.  Surgicel was then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscles as well as the appropriate fascial attachments were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.  The platysma was identified and approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture and the subdermal plane was approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture.  A running suture consisting of #5-0 Prolene suture was then placed and fast absorbing #6-0 was then placed in a running fashion.  Steri-Strips, Tincoban, bacitracin and a pressure gauze was then placed.  The patient was then admitted for further evaluation and supportive care.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.","endocrinology, thyroid goiter, graves disease, thyroidectomy, total thyroidectomy, dissection, superior, kitner"

" An 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation.", Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.

She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, hypokalemia, shortness of breath, atrial tachycardia, sinus rhythm, hip fracture, atrial, tachycardia, rhythm, apcs, cardiac, regurgitation, aortic, hypertension, pulmonary, "

She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A small bump was placed underneath her right buttock.  The right upper thigh was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The upper aspect of the incision was reincised.  The dissection was carried down to the crew, which was easily found.  A guidewire was placed inside the screw with subsequent removal of the previous screw.  The previous screw measured 65 mm.  A 60 mm screw was then placed under direct visualization with fluoroscopy.  The hip was taken through full range of motion to check on the length of the screw, which demonstrated no intraarticular protrusion.  The guidewire was removed.  The wound was then irrigated and closed using 2-0 Vicryl in the fascial layer as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape.  The area was infiltrated with total 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery.  She should continue toe touch weightbearing on her leg.  The wound may be wet in approximately 5 days.  The patient should follow up in clinic in about 10 days.  The patient is given Vicodin for pain.  Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother.","surgery, guidewire, capital femoral epiphysis, intraarticular protrusion, femoral epiphysis, pinning, screw,"

She developed constipation one week prior to admission and mother gave her MiraLax and her constipation improved.  She developed vomiting 3 days prior to admission, but did not have diarrhea.  She voided on the day of admission.  When she presented to the office, her weight was 124 pounds, which was approximately 10 pounds below previous weights and even had a weight of 151.5 pounds, 05/30/2007 and weight of 137.5 pounds, 09/11/2007 with mother giving no good explanation as to why she had lost all this weight.  She was admitted because of the persistent vomiting, but there was concern about the weight loss.,Physical examination on admission was unremarkable except for the obvious signs autistic spectrum disorder.,LABORATORY DATA:  ,Laboratory data included sedimentation rate of 12, magnesium level of 2.2, TSH of 2.63 with normal being 0.34 to 5.60, free T4 of 1.68 with normal being 0.58 to 1.64.  Chest x-ray and abdominal films were unremarkable.  Hemoglobin 14.5, hematocrit 43.5, platelet count 400,000, white blood count 11,800.  Urinalysis was negative for ketones.

In the hospital, her weight was 124 pounds, her height 58 inches, temperature 98.0 degree F., pulse 123, respirations 18, blood pressure 148/94.  Follow up blood pressure were some of them were in the 125 to 70 range making us think her hypertension as labile and perhaps related to the excitement of the admission.,She seem quite happy and in no distress at the time of discharge.  We will follow up in the office and try to further evaluate her for the unexplained weight loss.  She has been taking the Adderall for at least a year, and the mother does not think the Adderall is the cause of the weight loss.  The free T4 is borderline high and probably bears repeating along with further studies for Graves disease as an outpatient.","general medicine, gastroenteritis, autism, constipation, hyperactivity, blood pressure, weight loss, adderall"

 Transesophageal Echocardiogram.  A woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left-sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry. , Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , I was kindly asked to see this patient for transesophageal echocardiogram performance by Dr. A and Neurology.  Please see also my cardiovascular consultation dictated separately.  But essentially, this is a pleasant 72-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left-sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry.  She has been recommended for a transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her CNS insult.,I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter, who was present at the patient's bedside with the patient's verbal consent.  I then performed a risk/benefit/alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts; alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging, which she had already had, with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management, which the patient was not interested in; risks including, but not limited to, and the patient was aware this was not an all-inclusive list, of oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, risk of oropharyngeal, esophageal, oral, tracheal, pulmonary and/or gastric perforation, hemorrhage, or tear.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk/benefit/alternative analysis, had the opportunity to ask questions, which I invited from her and her daughter, all of which were answered to their self-stated satisfaction.  The patient then stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram.,PROCEDURE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient, position, physician, procedure documentation; there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself.  She received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect.  The multi-plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes, after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition.  This was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus, then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate imaging obtained throughout.  She was recovered as per the Medical Center conscious sedation protocol, and there were no apparent complications of the procedure.,FINDINGS: , Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  LVEF of 60%.  Mild left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.  Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.  No left ventricular wall motion abnormalities identified.  The four pulmonary veins are identified.  The left atrial appendage is interrogated, including with Doppler and color flow, and while there is good to-and-fro motion seen, echo smoke is seen, and in fact, an intracardiac thrombus is identified and circumscribed at 1.83 cm in circumference at the base of the left atrial appendage.  No intracardiac vegetations nor endocarditis seen on any of the intracardiac valves.  The mitral valve is seen.  There is mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.  No mitral stenosis.  Four pulmonary veins were identified without reversible pulmonary venous flow.  There are three cusps of the aortic valve seen.  No aortic stenosis.  There is trace aortic insufficiency.  There is trace pulmonic insufficiency.  The pulmonary artery is seen and is within normal limits.  There is trace to mild tricuspid regurgitation.  Unable to estimate PA systolic pressure accurately; however, on the recent transthoracic echocardiogram (which I would direct the reader to) on January 5, 2010, RVSP was calculated at 40 mmHg on that study.  E wave velocity on average is 0.95 m/sec with a deceleration time of 232 milliseconds.  The proximal aorta is within normal limits, annulus 1.19 cm, sinuses of Valsalva 2.54 cm, ascending aorta 2.61 cm.  The intra-atrial septum is identified as are the SVC and IVC, and these are within normal limits.  The intra-atrial septum is interrogated with color flow as well as agitated D5W and there is no evidence of intracardiac shunting, including no atrial septal defect nor patent foramen ovale.  No pericardial effusion.  There is mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis seen.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Left ventricular ejection fraction visually estimated at 60% without regional wall motion abnormalities.,2.  Mild left atrial enlargement.,3.  Intracardiac thrombus identified at the base of the left atrial appendage.,4.  Mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.,5.  Mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis.,Compared to the transthoracic echocardiogram done previously, other than identification of the intracardiac thrombus, other findings appear quite similar.,These results have been discussed with Dr. A of inpatient Internal Medicine service as well as the patient, who was recovering from conscious sedation, and her daughter with the patient's verbal consent.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, echo, thrombus, intracardiac, cardiovascular, pulmonary veins, intracardiac thrombus, transesophageal echocardiogram, echocardiogram, atrial, mca, cva, transesophageal, pulmonary, ventricular, aortic"

" Bifrontal cranioplasty, cranial defect greater than 10 cm in diameter in the frontal region.", Surgery,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cranial defect greater than 10 cm in diameter in the frontal region.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Cranial defect greater than 10 cm in diameter in the frontal region.,PROCEDURE: , Bifrontal cranioplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Nil.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman, who has a history of prior chondrosarcoma that he had multiple resections for.  The most recent one which I performed quite a number of years ago that was complicated by a bone flap infection and he has had removal of his bone flap.  He has been without the bone flap for a number of years now but has finally decided that he wanted to proceed with a cranioplasty.  After discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery, the decision was made to proceed with operative intervention in the form of a cranioplasty.  He had previously undergone a CT scan.  Premanufactured cranioplasty made for him that was sterile and ready to implant.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, an appropriate time out was performed.  We identified the patient, the location of surgery, the appropriate surgical procedure, and the appropriate implant.  He was given intravenous antibiotics with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl appropriately for antibiotic prophylaxis and sequential compression devices were used for deep venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.  The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A previous incision was reopened and the scalp flap was reflected forward.  We dissected off the dura and we were able to get a nice plane of dissection elevating the temporalis muscle along with the scalp flap.  We freed up the bony edges circumferentially, but except for the inferior frontal region where the vascularized pericranial graft took its vascular supply from we did not come across the base.  We did explore laterally and saw a little bit of the mesh on the lateral orbit.  Once we had the bony edges explored, we took the performed plate and secured it in a place with titanium plates and screws.  We had achieved good hemostasis.  The wound was closed in multiple layers in usual fashion over a Blake drain.  At the end of the procedure, all sponge and needle counts were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition after having tolerated the procedure well.  I was personally present and scrubbed and performed/supervised all key portions.","surgery, cranial defect, frontal region, bifrontal cranioplasty, cranioplasty, chondrosarcoma, scalp flap, bony edges, bone flap, bifrontal, cranial, endotracheal, frontal,"

Diagnosis was made some time in 2005/2006.  Initially, he underwent phlebotomy.  He subsequently transferred his care here.  In the past, he has been on hydroxyurea and interferon but did not tolerate both of them.  He is JAK-2 positive.  He does not have any siblings for a match-related transplant.  He was seen for consideration of a MUD transplant, but was deemed not to be a candidate because of the social support as well as his reasonably good health.,At our institution, the patient received a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for a short period.  He did well with the combination.  Subsequently, he developed intolerance to lenalidomide.  He complained of severe fatigue and diarrhea.  This was subsequently stopped.,The patient reports some injury to his left leg last week.  His left leg apparently was swollen.  He took steroids for about 3 days and stopped.  Left leg swelling has disappeared.  The patient denies any other complaints at this point in time.  He admits to smoking marijuana.  He says this gives him a great appetite and he has actually gained some weight.  Performance status in the ECOG scale is 1.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure 144/85, pulse 86, weight 61.8 kg, and respiratory rate 18 per minute.  GENERAL:  He is in no acute distress.  HEENT:  There is no pallor, icterus or cervical adenopathy that is noted.

The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",

In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.","surgery, cervical disk protrusions, cervical radiculopathy, cervical pain, cervical plate fixation, sofamor danek titanium window plate, anterior cervical discectomy, vertebral body, vertebral, disk, intraoperative, anterior, decompression, fluoroscopy, radiculopathy, discectomy, cervical,"

 Diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy., Neurology,"City, State,Dear Dr. Y:,I had the pleasure of seeing ABC today back in Neurology Clinic where he has been followed previously by Dr. Z.  His last visit was in June 2006, and he carries a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy.  To review, his birth was unremarkable.  He is a second child born to a G3, P1 to 2 female.  He has had normal development, and is a bright child in 7th grade.  He began having seizures, however, at 9 years of age.  It is manifested typically as generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening or falling into sleep.  He also had smaller spells with more focal convulsion and facial twitching.  His EEGs have shown a pattern consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy (central temporal sharp waves both of the right and left hemisphere).  Most recent EEG in May 2006 shows the same abnormalities.,ABC initially was placed on Tegretol, but developed symptoms of toxicity (hallucinations) on this medication, he was switched to Trileptal.  He has done very well taking 300 mg twice a day without any further seizures.  His last event was the day of his last EEG when he was sleep deprived and was off medication.  That was a convulsion lasting 5 minutes.  He has done well otherwise.  Parents deny that he has any problems with concentration.  He has not had any behavior issues.  He is an active child and participates in sports and some motocross activities.  He has one older sibling and he lives with his parents.  Father manages Turkey farm with foster farms.  Mother is an 8th grade teacher.,Family history is positive for a 3rd cousin, who has seizures, but the specific seizure type is not known.  There is no other relevant family history.,Review of systems is positive for right heel swelling and tenderness to palpation.  This is perhaps due to sports injury.  He has not sprained his ankle and does not have any specific acute injury around the time that this was noted.  He does also have some discomfort in the knees and ankles in the general sense with activities.  He has no rashes or any numbness, weakness or loss of skills.  He has no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  He has no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal complaints.,Past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.,Other workup includes CT scan and MRI scan of the brain, which are both normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  His weight today is 80.6 pounds.  Height is 58-1/4 inches.  Blood pressure 113/66.  Head circumference 36.3 cm.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Oropharynx shows no lesions.  NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.  CHEST:  Clear auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Benign without organomegaly.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented.  His cognitive skills appear normal for his age.  His speech is fluent and goal-directed.  He follows instructions well.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  Face moves symmetrically with normal sensation.  Palate elevates midline.  Tongue protrudes midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  Motor exam reveals normal strength and tone.  Sensation intact to light touch and vibration.  His gait is nonataxic with normal heel-toe and tandem.  Finger-to-nose, finger-nose-finger, rapid altering movements are normal.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.,IMPRESSION:  ,This is an 11-year-old male with benign rolandic epilepsy, who is followed over the past 2 years in our clinic.  Most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities, but it has not been done since May 2006.  The plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram, follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal.  At that time, he will be tapered off of medication.  I anticipate at some point in the near future, within about a year or so, he will actually be taken off medication.  For now, I will continue on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose for him.  There is no indication that his dose needs to be increased.  Family understands the plan.  We will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in Modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months.  Parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results.,Thank you very much for allowing me to access ABC for further management.","neurology, tonic-clonic seizures, benign rolandic epilepsy, rolandic epilepsy, epilepsy, seizures, electroencephalogram,"
" C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy, allograft fusion, and anterior plating.", Neurosurgery,"PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy, allograft fusion, and anterior plating.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 10 mL.,CLINICAL NOTE: , This is a 57-year-old gentleman with refractory neck pain with single-level degeneration of the cervical spine and there was also some arm pain.  We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.","neurosurgery, allograft fusion, anterior cervical discectomy, neck pain, cervical spine, discectomy, fusion, sternocleidomastoid muscle, assured hemostasis, anterior cervical, cervical discectomy, disc space, cervical, anterior, allograft"

She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum and due to the patient already being dilated approximately 2 cm, no cervical dilation was needed.  A size 12 straight suction curette was used and connected to the suction and was placed in the cervix and a suction curettage was performed.  Two passes were made with the suction curettage.  Next, a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a small amount of tissue and this was followed by third suction curettage and then a final sharp curettage was performed, which revealed a good uterine cry on all sides of the uterus.  After the procedure, the vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The cervix was seemed to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was removed.  The patient was given 0.25 mg of Methergine IM approximately half-way through the procedure.

The patient was noted with acute respiratory distress on ventilator support with both ventilator asynchrony and progressive desaturation.  Chest x-ray as noted above revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung.  The patient was subsequently sedated and received one dose of paralytic as noted above followed by emergent fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy.,PROCEDURE DETAIL,:  A bronchoscope was inserted through the oroendotracheal tube, which was partially obstructed with blood clots.  These were lavaged with several aliquots of normal saline until cleared.  The bronchoscope required removal because the tissue/clots were obstructing the bronchoscope.  The bronchoscope was reinserted on several occasions until cleared and advanced to the main carina.  The endotracheal tube was noted to be in good position.  The bronchoscope was advanced through the distal trachea.  There was a white tissue completely obstructing the left main stem at the carina.  The bronchoscope was advanced to this region and several aliquots of normal saline lavage were instilled and suctioned.  Again this partially obstructed the bronchoscope requiring several times removing the bronchoscope to clear the lumen.  The bronchoscope subsequently was advanced into the left mainstem and subsequently left upper and lower lobes.  There was diffuse mucus impactions/tissue as well as intermittent clots.  There was no evidence of any active bleeding noted.  Bronchoscope was adjusted and the left lung lavaged until no evidence of any endobronchial obstruction is noted.  Bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and advanced into the right bronchial system.  There is no plugging or obstruction of the right bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and slowly withdrawn as the position of endotracheal tube was verified, approximately 4 cm above the main carina.  The bronchoscope was then completely withdrawn as the patient was maintained on ventilator support during and postprocedure.

Cholelithiasis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS: , This is a 38-year-old diabetic Hispanic female patient, with ongoing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea.  Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient also had somewhat thickened gallbladder wall.  The patient was admitted through emergency room last night with acute onset right upper quadrant pain.  Clinically, it was felt the patient had acute cholecystitis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram was advised.  Procedure, indication, risk, and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia, and abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made just above the umbilicus under local anesthesia.  Fascia was opened vertically.  Stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted and peritoneal cavity was insufflated with CO2.,Laparoscopic camera was inserted, and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg, rotated to the left.  A 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Examination at this time showed no free fluid, no acute inflammatory changes.  Liver was grossly normal.  Gallbladder was noted to be thickened.  Gallbladder wall with a stone stuck in the neck of the gallbladder and pericholecystic edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis.,The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly, and dissection was carried at the neck of the gallbladder where a cystic duct was identified and isolated.  It was clipped distally and using C-arm fluoroscopy, intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done, which was interpreted as normal.  There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted.  It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly.  The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips.  Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided.,The gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port.  Specimen was sent for histopathology.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  Trocars were removed under direct vision and peritoneal cavity was evacuated with CO2.  Umbilical area fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, required extra sutures to close the fascial defect.  Some difficulty was encountered closing the fascia initially because of the patient's significant amount of subcutaneous fat.  In the end, the repair appears to be quite satisfactory.  Rest of the incisions closed with 3-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.","gastroenterology, cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, laparoscopic, cholecystectomy, cholangiogram, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gallbladder,"

Harvesting of bone for autologous vertebral bodies for creation of arthrodesis.,5.  Grafting of fibular allograft bone for creation of arthrodesis.,6.  Creation of arthrodesis via an anterior technique with fibular allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral bodies.,7.  Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has progressive and intractable right C4 radiculopathy with neck and shoulder pain.  Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem.  Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses.  The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck.  Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space.  Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4.  Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed.  Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed.  As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized.,There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs.  A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away.  I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura.,Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen.  The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas.  I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root.  All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura.  However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen.  An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact.,The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed.,Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration.  Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally.  Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well.  An x-ray showed good graft placement.,Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation.  A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws.  Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase.  Next, the locking screws were then applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws.  The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3.  The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs.  Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate.,Attention was turned to closure.  A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar.  The operation was then terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisted of bone and soft tissue as well as C3-C4 disc material.","neurosurgery, herniated, osteophytes, nerve root decompression, harvesting, autologous, vertebral, arthrodesis, anterior technique, anterior cervical discectomy, spinal cord compression, fibular allograft bone, creation of arthrodesis, cervical discectomy, spinal instrumentation, cord compression, vertebral body, vertebral bodies, spinal cord, bone, instrumentation, cervical, anterior, grafting, spinal, discectomy, allograft, "

There was a large amount of tissue obtained on the procedure.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum and due to the patient already being dilated approximately 2 cm, no cervical dilation was needed.  A size 12 straight suction curette was used and connected to the suction and was placed in the cervix and a suction curettage was performed.  Two passes were made with the suction curettage.  Next, a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a small amount of tissue and this was followed by third suction curettage and then a final sharp curettage was performed, which revealed a good uterine cry on all sides of the uterus.  After the procedure, the vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The cervix was seemed to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was removed.  The patient was given 0.25 mg of Methergine IM approximately half-way through the procedure.  After the procedure, a second bimanual exam was performed and the patient's uterus had significantly decreased in size.  It is now approximately eight to ten-week size.  The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition after she was cleaned.  She will be discharged on today.  She was given Methergine, Motrin, and doxycycline for her postoperative care.  She will follow-up in one week in the office.","surgery, uterus, anteverted, dorsal lithotomy position, weighted speculum, mobile uterus, vulsellum tenaculum, bimanual exam, vagina, tenaculum, dilation, bimanual, cervix, suction, curettage,"
